#HW17
#1.) The run value of a single and a home run varies
#greatly, with a home run producing significantly
#more runs. When considering the amount of outs,
#this differential becomes even more significant,
#with a home run frequently providing a solid source
#of runs even when there are outs on the board,
#but singles are less likely to result in runs
#in such instances. 
#2.) The worth of a successful stolen base is
#determined by the game circumstances, the unique
#setting, and the ramifications of a failed effort.
#When employed wisely, it may be an effective
#strategy, especially in low-scoring games or when
#the team needs a run.

# Example usage:
# To calculate the run value of a single with a runner on 2nd and 1 out, you can do:
run_value <- calculate_run_value("1 Out", "Runner on 2nd")
print(run_value)
